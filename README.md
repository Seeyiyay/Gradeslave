# Gradeslave

Gradeslave is a project about getting basic Q-Learning to play heads up, limits holdem poker reasonably well. While not complete yet, it will, statistically in the long run, win against a player that always calls!

Further improvements we are looking at include:
* Tidying up the code, making a lot of the logic less convuluted and making the project extendable with better use of interfaces.
* The ability for the program to play against itself, and learn from this.
* A basic interface for a human to play against it.
* A GUI interface to make using/playing against it easier/more fun.

Shout-out to phstc at https://github.com/phstc/javapokertexasholdem/tree/master/src/com/cantero/games/poker/texasholdem for the skeleton code for the poker rules.
